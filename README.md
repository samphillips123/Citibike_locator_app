# citybike_locator_app
# Locate citybike share locations utilizing js, css, html, and fetching from API - Project Zero - GA
# Created by Samuel Phillips - July 2023
# Presented v1.0 on August 2, 2023

# Data is fetched from the CityBikes API - https://api.citybik.es/v2/#filter

# 

# Minimum goals:
# Produce an app that can be used to search for general locations which will produce a response from the API in a list view of all citybike share locations in that area.
# Responses will show the user how many bikes/electric bikes are available to rent and if/how many stalls are available to return bikes. 
# UI will be modified for best use on desktop, tablet, and cell phone.
# When user enters a search, an animation will initiate while data is being fetched.

# Stretch goals:
# User will be able to toggle between a list view (default) and a map view that pinpoints the locations.
# Search bar will auto generate entries based off what the user has started to type.
# If no bikes are available to rent or no stalls available for returns, app will tell user the next closest location.

# Plans for future updates:
# Add map for visual of station locations
# When station is selected, map will open with that location.
# Ability to navigate to station location based off user's location.
# Figure out how to successfully use the sticky header without the results appearing behind it.
# Allow the results section to be scrollable.
# Have wheel icon appear over the top of all other items at the center of the screen when search is initiated.
